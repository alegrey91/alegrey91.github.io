## About me

I work as Software Engineer at Suse, where I occasionally write bugs. I orbit around the Open-Source since 2010. I live in a nice city near Rome, called Tivoli (which I highly recommend you to visit if you are close to here).
I'm a self-taught, always curious about what surrounds me. I feed my soul gaining knowledge from different cultures, through the trips I often do.
I love feeding my body tasting good food sharing it with my friends and my partner Martina. I truly believe this is the best way to delve into a different culture.

## About this blog

This blog is not meant to be exclusively focused on tech related topics. Instead, here, I would try to express myself and my creativity on different topics. I cannot guarantee this blog will always be written in English. In some special cases I might use my native language (Italian) to exhaustively express my thoughts, which might be hard using a non-native language.
I created this blog as a form of self-expression—like a jeweler's piece displayed in a shop window—yet, like software, it's something that can be updated and refined over time.
