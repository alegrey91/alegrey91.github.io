# About Traveling

It has been a while since I started thinking that traveling is wrongly meant as taking a flight, walking around the city, visiting the monuments, etc.
I recently came across an Airbnb [commercial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pjydd52XNJ0) and finally got the motivation to write about that.
