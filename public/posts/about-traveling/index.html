  About Traveling
  
    
    Link to heading
  

It has been a while since I started thinking that traveling is wrongly tought as taking the flight, walking around the city, visiting the monuments and get back home.
I recently came across an Airbnb commercial and finally got the motivation to write about that.
Traveling, in the past, was intended as departing for an unknown destination. Without knowing how much time would have been passed, without knowing how would you have come back.
All these ingredients, mixed together, gave the &ldquo;travel&rdquo;.">

<p>It has been a while since I started thinking that <strong>traveling</strong> is wrongly tought as taking the flight, walking around the city, visiting the monuments and get back home.
I recently came across an Airbnb <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pjydd52XNJ0"  class="external-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener">commercial</a> and finally got the motivation to write about that.</p>
<p>Traveling, in the past, was intended as departing for an unknown destination. Without knowing how much time would have been passed, without knowing how would you have come back.
All these ingredients, mixed together, gave the &ldquo;travel&rdquo;.</p>
<p>Traveling, in the new ages, has completely changed its meaning becoming extremely easy to do. There are tons of websites offering pre-made trips without the need of booking neither a flight. This ease encouraged people of traveling more often, more economically and sadly.. more disinterested. I have literally seen people taking pictures about famous places without watching them.</p>
<p>This made me reflect about the great opportunity we have now compared to the past. But, as said, this great opportunity brings also a lot of concerns.
What can I do to not fall into the trap of these easy trips?</p>
