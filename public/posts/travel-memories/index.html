If I&rsquo;m not mistaken, I paid just 19€ for a round trip to London.
Since then, I&rsquo;ve been lucky enough to take many trips and collect some stories along the way.">

<p>The sole purpose of these stories is to keep them alive in my memory over time. They are the best souvenirs I&rsquo;ve ever brought home, and I&rsquo;m so fond of them that I wanted to write them down, to make sure I never forget.</p>

<p>I think every traveler experiences this at some point.
For me, it happened during a unique moment in my life, when a single night spent in an airport served as a bridge between two important events.
But let me start from the beginning.</p>
<p>In February 2023, I began a new job at an Israeli cybersecurity company. I was incredibly excited (I&rsquo;d never worked for an international company before).
I met great people from all over the world and had the opportunity to visit a country as magnificent as it is controversial, as Israel.
That trip was planned for May, just a few months after I started.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, my brother was preparing for his wedding in August. I had the honor of being one of his witnesses.
Now, I&rsquo;m not sure what the tradition is in other countries, but in Italy, the witness is usually responsible for organizing the groom&rsquo;s bachelor party.
Trust me: planning a bachelor party abroad for 15 people is no joke.</p>
<p>After a few months at the company, came the big announcement: &ldquo;We&rsquo;re going to host a team-building retreat in Tel-Aviv.&rdquo;
I was thrilled, finally, I&rsquo;d get to meet my colleagues in person and visit a country I&rsquo;d only known through video calls.
But then came the problem: the retreat dates overlapped with the bachelor party.
I was torn. On one side, a professional experience I had always dreamed of. On the other hand, one of the most important moments in my brother&rsquo;s life.
I couldn&rsquo;t miss either, so I made it work. From Saturday to Thursday, I&rsquo;d be in Israel for the retreat. From Friday to Sunday, I&rsquo;d be in Barcelona for the bachelor party.
In between, I&rsquo;d spend one night sleeping at Rome Fiumicino airport.</p>
<p>On the day of departure from Tel-Aviv, I arrived at Ben-Gurion Airport three hours early, as my colleagues had strongly advised.
You&rsquo;d be surprised how long it takes to leave Israel.
I went through several security checks, had to empty my suitcase, and even watched my (very visibly transparent) glasses go through a metal detector (🤔).</p>
<p>After surviving all of that, I flew back to Rome and landed at 22:15. My next flight, to Barcelona, was at 9:50 the next morning.
So I spent over 11 hours at the airport. Needless to say, it wasn&rsquo;t the most comfortable experience, but it was worth it!</p>
